Unresolved issues to ask about in the code review
======================

If there is a way to add `rm -rf .stack-work/th-module-data` to
the `stack clean` command, the README should recomend doing that.
I should add simmilar advice for `cabal`.

Efficent append? Mutable vectors? Should I just give up and use a list?
